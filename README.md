### Uber Simple CTF Management Server 

Made with flask and python

- works on koyeb (Procfile), vercel (vercel.json), pythonanywhere (wsgi) or render.com (nearly out of the box)


Meant for individual users to solve a CTF challenge in sequential order via flags

Passwords and secrets are hardcoded in the code, so don't use this for anything serious
